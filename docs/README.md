## OctoAcme Project Management Processes — Summary

OctoAcme’s project management is built on structured, customer-centric workflows, rigorous communication, and strong ownership. Projects begin with clear problem validation and stakeholder alignment, followed by collaborative planning where deliverables are mapped, risks registered, and responsibilities assigned. Execution is tracked via project boards (with columns from Backlog to Done), regular standups, and milestone demos, enabling transparent progress monitoring.

Roles are well-defined: Project Managers oversee delivery, scheduling, and risk; Product Managers keep outcomes customer-focused and prioritize backlogs; Developers design, build, test, and review work, collaborating with QA and stakeholders. Communication is deliberate—weekly syncs, frequent standups, and consistent status updates keep everyone aligned and enable prompt escalation of blockers.

Quality assurance is embedded throughout, with automated CI pipelines for tests and lint, manual QA and security scans before releases, and strict definitions of done and acceptance criteria. Releases use a standardized checklist (backups, smoke tests, rollback plans) to reduce risk and improve observability. Retrospectives after each milestone or incident ensure lessons become actionable improvements.

Centralized documentation and repeatable processes ensure every team member has equal, reliable access to knowledge—accelerating onboarding, reducing dependency risk, and making project delivery consistent and high-quality.
